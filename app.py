**Systemic Resilience Simulator**  
Explore how system-level decisions — from infrastructure to income policy — shape real-world outcomes like housing stability, education access, and long-term prosperity.

This tool simulates structural pressure points, helps surface overlooked costs, and suggests new incentive paths for sustainable economic wellbeing.

# Intro Section
st.markdown("""
> **What does it really cost to be alive in modern society?**
>
> This interactive tool explores the hidden strain on individuals and communities — from housing, food, and transportation, to decaying infrastructure and underfunded education. Instead of assigning blame, we use data-driven models to ask:
>
> **What if we restructured society to reduce suffering and unlock human potential for everyone?**

**This simulator lets you:**
- Estimate the minimum viable cost of living
- See how infrastructure investments affect human outcomes
- Explore the economic ripple effects of supporting non-working populations
- Test reforms like income stabilization and public investment incentives

**Our goal:** To inspire citizens, policymakers, and businesses to reimagine prosperity — not just as GDP, but as shared human flourishing.

🛠️ _Taking care of people is not a burden — it's the engine of a stable and thriving society._
