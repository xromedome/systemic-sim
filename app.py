# Intro Section
st.markdown("""
> **What does it really cost to be alive in modern society?**
>
> This interactive tool explores the hidden strain on individuals and communities ‚Äî from housing, food, and transportation, to decaying infrastructure and underfunded education. Instead of assigning blame, we use data-driven models to ask:
>
> **What if we restructured society to reduce suffering and unlock human potential for everyone?**

**This simulator lets you:**
- Estimate the minimum viable cost of living
- See how infrastructure investments affect human outcomes
- Explore the economic ripple effects of supporting non-working populations
- Test reforms like income stabilization and public investment incentives

**Our goal:** To inspire citizens, policymakers, and businesses to reimagine prosperity ‚Äî not just as GDP, but as shared human flourishing.

üõ†Ô∏è _Taking care of people is not a burden ‚Äî it's the engine of a stable and thriving society._

This module simulates the effects of income stabilization on societal stress, economic participation,
and long-term productivity. It explores how supporting non-working populations can lead to net gains
in innovation, health, education, and economic resilience.

**Key assumptions:**
- Stabilization amount per adult per month
- Reduction in healthcare/emergency costs
- Increase in education participation and small business creation
- Corporate gains from healthier, more creative society
